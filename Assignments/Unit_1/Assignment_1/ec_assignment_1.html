	<h3>My name is Eric and I'm a current fellow in the 2019 Movement Tech. Fellowship. Here are three quick details about me!</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>I currently work at the Asian Pacific Environmental Network as an Operations Associate for our satellite office in Oakland Chinatown.</li>
		<li>I was born and raised in San Francisco, and recently moved to Oakland in 2017.</li>
		<li>One of my favorite foods to eat is pho, or noodle soups in general.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>What do I hope to get out of this fellowship?</h3>
	<p>I have no experience coding and little experience with CRMs, so I'm truly excited to just learn and grow, to see what I enjoy and to challenge myself. I'm also excited to learn more about the tech. world and how movements have been shaped by technology, as well as what the future will look like with new, evolving and emerging forms of tech. I hope that by the end of this fellowship I will have worked on projects that will bring about tangible and felt change to APEN, specifically to our database management systems and infrastructure. I want APEN to at least adopt one system or protocol that helps us be more efficient and save time.</p>
